#             Humankind are deep down the software rabbit hole. Billions of us depend upon software that doesn't expose each of us to undue risk. Our                     dependence reaches far beyond those of us rich enough to work from cafes. Herders and subsistence farmers rely on their mobile phones for                   critical services even if these people live outside the "internet bubble". Who writes this software? Tens of millions of programmers across the             globe. Most of these do not work at "Enterprises" or even SMBs (Small Medium Businesses). And yet, every single one of these programmers can               add to our collective AppSec burden, i.e., exploitable conditions. If AppSec is to be truly global, we must embrace the challenges of a world               of software and software developers in order to truly be "global".
