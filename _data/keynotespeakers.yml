   abstract: Large enterprises struggle with software vulnerabilities: complex systems, slow patching, and poor risk prioritisation lead to security weaknesses, breaches, and data exposure. In this talk, we will show how one can leverage recent advances in LLMs and generative AI to create and validate private, secure and multiple file fixes that rival even expert developers. State of the art, SOTA, AI open-source models, like StarCoder, for code generation and assistance can enable enterprises to securely and privately remediate vulnerabilities in applications without worrying about risks of using OpenAI APIs. We can now empower security and operations teams to go beyond monitoring and finding issues to being able to actually fix them, even when they do not have developer experience or access. In the near future, we foresee a world where developers are no longer the sole bearers of the application security burden - A DevLess, developer-less, Security world.

#             Humankind are deep down the software rabbit hole. Billions of us depend upon software that doesn't expose each of us to undue risk. Our                     dependence reaches far beyond those of us rich enough to work from cafes. Herders and subsistence farmers rely on their mobile phones for                   critical services even if these people live outside the "internet bubble". Who writes this software? Tens of millions of programmers across the             globe. Most of these do not work at "Enterprises" or even SMBs (Small Medium Businesses). And yet, every single one of these programmers can               add to our collective AppSec burden, i.e., exploitable conditions. If AppSec is to be truly global, we must embrace the challenges of a world               of software and software developers in order to truly be "global".
