        Large enterprises struggle with software vulnerabilities; complex systems, slow patching, and poor risk prioritisation lead to security weaknesses, 
        breaches, and data exposure. In this talk, we will show how one can leverage recent advances in LLMs and generative AI to create and validate private, 
        secure and multiple file fixes that rival even expert developers. State of the art, SOTA, AI open-source models, like StarCoder, for code generation 
        and assistance can enable enterprises to securely and privately remediate vulnerabilities in applications without worrying about risks of using OpenAI 
        APIs. We can now empower security and operations teams to go beyond monitoring and finding issues to being able to actually fix them, even when they do 
        not have developer experience or access. In the near future, we foresee a world where developers are no longer the sole bearers of the application security 
        burden - A DevLess, developer-less, Security world.

       What makes software great? Is it because its anatomy can be simple, complex, or both? Or could it be because of its soft nature, or fragile if you wish? While these are positive characteristics, they inadvertently increase a software's attackable surface area.

As software becomes more complex, fragile and "softer", cyber adversaries have more opportunities to exploit and cause damage. Developers must balance between developing software quickly and securely while ensuring its fragility is not exploited.
 
This sharing will discuss the different software fragility archetypes and explore the "Wellness" option to strengthen a software's anatomy with a sustainable, secure, robust foundation.
