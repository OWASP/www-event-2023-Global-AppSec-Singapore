   Title: Don’t trust my input- Frontend Security for Developers and Testers
   SectionId: sku_IWAHBB
   Description: >-
       This training focuses entirely on frontend security. For one day we don't look at the backend; instead, we focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in the frontend application to target other users. The course covers various topics, including simple and advanced Cross-Site Scripting XXS, Same-Origin Policy, and browser-based defense mechanisms. Through this training, participants can gain a deeper understanding of frontend security, as well as the intricate behavior of web browsers.
       This course is highly beneficial for web developers who write frontend or full-stack code, as well as security specialists who primarily focus on backend attacks. Our instructors will teach you how to perform attacks using popular tools such as Burp or OWASP ZAP. We believe that conducting attacks ourselves is the best and most enjoyable way to learn about security. To facilitate this, we provide a lab environment that each participant can use during the training to explore artificial but realistic vulnerabilities. Additionally, we also discuss possible mitigations and how they can be implemented to enhance security.
